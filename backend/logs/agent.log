It also doesn't directly apply to entities like Workers' Compensation or life insurance companies, even if they receive health information from covered entities. Additionally, criminal penalties might not extend to employees of covered entities or others who improperly access or share health information, even for profit or harm, based on one interpretation.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services can issue civil monetary penalties to covered entities for not following the Privacy Rule. The Department of Justice enforces criminal penalties for individuals who knowingly obtain or share identifiable health information illegally. These criminal penalties are stricter for actions involving false pretenses or intent to sell or use the information for commercial gain, personal benefit, or malicious harm.\n\nGenerally, the Privacy Rule prevents the sharing of individually identifiable health information for purposes outside of defined healthcare activities unless the patient gives specific written permission beforehand.\n\nHIPAA establishes a federal baseline for privacy. It overrides state laws that offer less protection but permits state laws with equal or stronger privacy protections to remain. This means covered entities must follow both federal and any stricter state rules, leading to varying privacy standards across states."}
